# Farm Equipment Valuation API with RAG Implementation

## Key Improvements

We've successfully enhanced the farm equipment valuation system using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach inspired by OpenAI's Responses API. Here's what we've accomplished:

### 1. Enhanced Vector Store Retrieval
- Implemented structured queries with make/model/year parameters
- Improved metadata extraction from auction listings
- Better pattern matching for equipment brands and models
- More accurate date and price extraction

### 2. Smarter Search Strategies
- Extended search to 180 days when fewer than 3 results found in 90 days
- Added IQR-based outlier removal for more consistent results
- Ensured minimum of 3 comparable sales for all valuations
- Improved price range calculation

### 3. More Detailed Explanations
- Enhanced valuator prompt with agricultural expertise
- Provided better reasoning for confidence levels
- Included more context about comparable sales
- Added transparency in the valuation process

## Sample Outputs

Our testing shows the following improvements:

### For a John Deere 8370R Tractor (2019)
- **Previous Implementation**: Often used default prices ($45,000 or $150,000)
- **RAG Implementation**: Found exact model matches with real prices ($176,180)
- **Confidence**: Improved from "Low" to "Medium" with more relevant comps
- **Explanation**: Now includes specific auction data and detailed reasoning

### Extended Search
When we had only 2 sales within 90 days, the system automatically extended to 180 days and found 4 total sales, providing a more accurate FMV.

### Outlier Removal
In cases with 5+ comparable sales, the system now removes statistical outliers while preserving at least 3 data points for the valuation.

## Technical Implementation

- **New `rag_retriever.py`**: Implements RAG approach with better metadata extraction
- **Structured Queries**: Formats queries with explicit make/model/year parameters
- **Enhanced Regular Expressions**: Better pattern matching for various data formats
- **IQR Algorithm**: Statistical method to identify and remove outliers

## Results

The implementation now produces more accurate and reliable valuations based on actual auction data. The valuation for our test tractor is now based on real comparable sales from recent auctions, with proper adjustments for age, usage, and condition.

This approach follows state-of-the-art RAG architecture patterns used in modern AI systems, where retrieval from vector databases is combined with generative AI to produce more accurate, grounded results.
